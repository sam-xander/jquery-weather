# Weather Forecast App

### View project [here](https://sam-xander.github.io/weather-forecast/)

This is a weather forecast app built with JavaScript that allows users to search a city and the weather data is fetched to present to them. The data persists through refreshes with local storage and places are saved to history for users to search again. This app uses [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
